unionfs-fuse - A userspace unionfs implementation.

unionfs-fuse overlays several directories into one single mount point.
It first tries to access the file on the top branch and if the file
does not exist there, it continues on lower level branches. If the
user tries to modify a file on a lower level read-only branch the
the file is copied to a higher levelread-write branch if the
copy-on-write mode was enabled.
