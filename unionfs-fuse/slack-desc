# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

unionfs-fuse: unionfs-fuse - A userspace unionfs implementation.
unionfs-fuse:
unionfs-fuse: unionfs-fuse overlays several directories into one single mount point.
unionfs-fuse: It first tries to access the file on the top branch and if the file
unionfs-fuse: does not exist there, it continues on lower level branches. If the
unionfs-fuse: user tries to modify a file on a lower level read-only branch the
unionfs-fuse: the file is copied to a higher levelread-write branch if the
unionfs-fuse: copy-on-write mode was enabled.
